# Minecraft-Session-Login
a simple mod that allows you to login to minecraft accounts using your session id instead of regular login


to open the interface, run the /session command ingame. all fields should be self explanatory

Due to my lack of understanding stuff, there is no support yet for public keys, meaning this mod wont work for servers > 1.19.2 that have secure profiles enabled
