Mod i made becuz i have alot of mc accounts. i use this to login with session ids.

when you go to the multiplayer menu it will show the username of ur current id, or it will show offline if you are a pirate. it wil also have a little button to add a new id. click that and it will open a menu with a box for you to enter the id. it will freeze for a second, login and show the name. or crash the game if the session id is bad, i refuse to fix it!
